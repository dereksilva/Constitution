# Constitution
This Repository chronicles the drafting of the Liberland Constitution. 

Please visit the **issues** to see the current matters on which you are welcome to help us. Please visit the **projects** to see the overall structure of the Constitution's legislative process. Please visit the **discussions** to propose changes and new institutes.

The drafting takes place in a Google Doc. The various milestones are then converted to markdown and uploaded to this Repository, and so will be the final draft. 
The Constitution shall take force after Liberland Citizens adopt it in a Referendum.
