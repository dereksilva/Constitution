## Preamble

 

We, the People of the Free World, in order to protect our right to life, to our property and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this Constitution of the Free Republic of Liberland.

## Book 1

Basic Principles

 

**Art. 1**

**Right to Property in One’s Being, or Right to Life**

 

§ 1

1) A human being has the sole, undivided and absolute ownership of their Person; their body, their mind and their actions; for the duration of their natural life. 

2) This right to ownership, or Property, in one’s own being, is recognized as self-evident and is the basis of all liberty. It shall be respected by all Persons and protected against all who would infringe upon it.

 

**Art. 2**

**Freedom to Act**

 

§ 2

A human being owns the Property in their own human actions. They are free to act or refrain from action as they see fit as long as their actions concern their own Property and do not interfere with the Property of others.

 

**Art. 3**

**Right to Property in Objects**

 

§ 3

A Person who acts and mixes their labor with a thing, an animal or with any other controllable natural phenomenon, henceforth: “Object”, which is as of yet unowned by another Person, shall be acknowledged as the owner of that Object and the Object becomes their Property. 

 

§ 4

A Person shall in no wise be limited in their free disposal of their Property and they may change the Object of it or destroy the Object, as they see fit. 

 

§ 5

1) A Person shall in no wise be limited in their freedom to transfer their ownership of the object of their Property, in whole or in part, for the good of a different Person.

That other person shall thus become the new owner of that Property according to the extent in which the previous owner transferred the Property, or a part thereof, to them.

2) A Person may likewise relinquish an owned Object, or its part, and the relinquished Property shall then become liable to be claimed for ownership by another Person.

3) In case the actions described under 1) and 2) lead to the ownership of two Persons in different Properties of one object, those Persons become co-owners of that object, each holding a distinct Property in it.

 

§ 6

A Person shall be acknowledged as the owner of their Property for as long as they see it fit and Property shall not diminish nor disappear with time.

 

§ 7

At any given time, a specific Property to one distinct Object shall only be owned by one Person and no Person shall assume the ownership of a Property that is already owned by another. 

 

**Art. 4**

**Non Aggression Principle**

 

§ 8

No Person shall act upon a Property of which they are not the owner without the express permission of the owner of that Property.

 

§ 9

1) A Person shall have the right to protect their Property, including their own Person, as well as the Object of that Property, from infringement.

2) A Person shall likewise have the right to protect the Property of others, including their Persons, as long as it is with their agreement and informed consent also as to the nature of that protection.

 

§ 10

1) It is a common practice amongst the People of the Free World to establish bodies based on voluntary cooperation which further coordinate human action. 

2) The right of Persons to establish such bodies and to choose from amongst their membership their coordinators and representatives, shall be respected.



## Book 2

Public administration

 

**Art. 1**

**Stated Purpose**

 

§ 11

To ensure that the Right to Property shall under all circumstances be respected and efficiently protected, even in situations when it is not in the powers of the owner to ensure this protection themselves, the Public Administration of the Free Republic of Liberland,henceforth “Public Administration”, shall be established.



§ 12

The purpose of the Public Administration shall be to act as the public protector of the Right to Life and the Right to Property in Objects and as the public guarantor of the Non Aggression Principle. 



§ 13

1) Public Administration shall only perform such actions to which it is empowered, directly or indirectly, by this Constitution and it shall only act inasmuch as is necessary to fulfill its purpose as stated in this Constitution.

2) Public Administration shall act using its employees and other people, such as volunteers and contractors. Any Persons acting in this capacity shall be called Agents of the Public Administration,henceforth ‘Agents’.

 

**Art. 2**

**Regulative Power**

 

§ 14

1) To make sure that the social situation will be stable and conductive for the Stated Purpose, Public Administration shall establish rules and guidelines that inform human action and guide the people to act in ways which are more predictable and less likely to clash with actions of other people.

2) This shall be accomplished by the issuance of Regulations within the limits of this Constitution, which shall not deny, but better define and specify the meanings of the Freedom to Act and shall enable a better and a more universal application of the Non Aggression Principle.

3) Regulations shall be binding on Persons inasmuch as they conform to this Constitution. 

 

§ 15

1) Public Administration and this Constitution shall consider such a human action as shall conform not only to this Constitution but also to all valid regulations of Public Administration to be a ‘Lawful action’. 

2) Lawful action shall profit from special rights and freedoms according to this Constitution as it represents less of a risk to the peace and stability of the community than other action.

 

§ 16

Public Administration shall only use its regulatory power when given the power to it by this constitution. All regulations shall be made in all ways conform with a strict interpretation of this Constitution.

 

§ 17

Public Administration shall obey its own regulations. 

 

**Art. 2** 

**Division of Power**

 

§ 18

​	1) In order to safeguard the workings of the Free Republic of Liberland,henceforth “Liberland”, from tyranny or from the takeover of Liberland by special interests through the Public Administration, shall the Public Administration be composed not of one institution nor shall it be based on one nexus of power, but it shall be divided, and that into at least three distinct branches of power: the Judicial Power, the Legislative Power and the Executive Power.

2) Each branch shall be distinct in its tasks and in its powers and those tasks and powers shall be described with great precision in this Constitution

 

**Art. 3**

**Limits of Power**

 

§ 21

1) Any regulative, especially legislative action of the Public Administration shall be liable to be tested against this Constitution directly in any  legal dispute or arbitration or any other action in law and in other situations prescribed by this Constitution.

2) Only such Regulation as is liable to pass a Constitutional test of conformity shall serve as the binding interpretation of this Constitution. 

 

§ 22

1) Because Public Administration is mandated to further specify what is lawful in human action and it hereby sets boundaries on human action, it presents the risk that it could abuse the powers entrusted to it and use them against Persons in a manner which does not conform to the basic principles of this Constitution. 

2) To mitigate this risk and to prevent this abuse of power where possible, Public Administration shall in any and all of their actions, in their policy making and in their day to day business respect and protect certain principles and limitations and affort certain rights to all human beings.

3) This Constitution provides the list of these principles, limitations and rights to which Public Administration shall always adhere and which shall form the cornerstone of their work ,henceforth “the Bill of Rights”.

 

§ 23

Public Administration shall interpret and apply those human rights in ways which are the most conducive to the freedom of the individual and to the principles it exists to safeguard.

 

§ 24

1) The list enshrined in the Bill of Rights is in no wise exhaustive and it can be expanded by later Regulations.

2) No rights shall be added that would not be compatible with this Constitution and with its basic principles.

a) to demand payments of a Land Fee set up according to Law and this Constitution, beforehand and in a transparent manner; and

§ 47

Price of goods and services shall be seen as an indicator of objective levels of scarcity on the market with said goods and services.

Money is that which the people choose to use a medium of exchange and the price of money is that for which that money sells on the free market. Public Administration shall never engage in restricting a particular commodity from being used as money or a money-like instrument.

 

§ 51

1) Rent on borrowed assets represents the value of time preference on the market and as such is an important indicator for all actors of the market. Manipulating the rent, directly or indirectly, leads to confusion and infringes the value of one’s property on the free market.

2) There shall therefore never be a public central bank-like institution in Liberland and Public Administration shall not engage in any monetary or fiscal policy of any kind, neither adjusting the rent nor hoarding or releasing the supply of any money or money like instrument, nor in any other such measure, known or as of yet unknown to legal science or economy.

Public administration shall never impair special rights to banks and other financial institutions to protect them from bankruptcy should they not have enough assets to cover all their liabilities.

§ 54

1) All private personal data collected by the Public Administration shall be used only for the purposes for which they were collected.

3) All individuals, whose data is being stored by the Public Administration, shall be entitled to obtain a copy of the data upon asking for it.

 

§ 55

1) Public Administration shall require no Person to register and/or share information about themselves, their religion, medical conditions, fingerprints, DNA, political affiliation and the like.

2) Public Administration shall likewise not require no Person to register and/or share information about their whereabouts, be it permanent or temporary, assets, be it tangible or intangible, and/or signed contracts, be it employment, commercial or otherwise, unless pursuant to a Warrant.

## Book 4

Legislative Power

 

**Art. 1**

**Citizenship**

 

§ 81

To facilitate the regularity of the application of collective power, Public Administration shall bestow upon certain Persons the right to enact Regulations upon themselves and others, even against the will of the recipients or without asking for their consent, but only within the strict limits of this Constitution. These Persons shall be known as Citizens.

 

§ 82

1) Citizens shall be those Persons who by accepting upon themselves the duties of Citizenship prove their personal involvement and their closer attachment to the fortunes and the future of Liberland.

§ 84

1) Citizenship shall have the form of a private law contract between Liberland and the Citizen and that contract shall always include the option of ending this relationship without excessive penalties on part of the Citizen. 

2) Public Administration shall propose a Regulation which shall include the binding model for the Citizenship contract. The Contract shall contain a stipulation for citizens to suffer under certain conditions one-sided changes of the Contract should the content of the Regulation change, to prevent the existence of Citizens bound by multiple sorts of obligations.
