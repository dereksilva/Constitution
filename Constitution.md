Preamble
========

We, the free people of this world, in order to protect our right to Life, to our Property, and to secure liberty for ourselves and for future generations, do establish this Constitution of the Republic of Liberland.

Book 1
======

Basic Principles
================

### Art. 1
### Self-Sovereignty

We affirm that every human being has sole, undivided, and absolute sovereignty over their Person; their body, and their mind. This relationship between the human being and their Person shall be called Property, and it shall be afforded the highest degree of protection by everyone and for everyone equally.

### Art. 2
### Human Action

We affirm that a human being is uniquely able to act by their Person; hence, their relationship to their actions shall be akin to Property and likewise protected against all infringement.

### Art. 3
### Appropriation of Objects

Where a Person who acts and adds value to something in the world, be it a thing, an animal, or any other controllable natural phenomenon, henceforth: "Object," which is as of yet unowned by another Person, that Object shall become the Property of the acting Person.

### Art. 4
### Property in Objects

A Person shall be free to act on their Property as they see fit, use it, relinquish it, destroy it or transfer it for the good of a different Person.

### Art. 5
### Non-Perishable Nature of Property

A Person shall be acknowledged as the owner of their Property for as long as they see fit, and the rights of the owner towards the object of their Property shall not diminish nor disappear with the passage of time alone.

### Art. 6
### Non-Aggression Principle

A Person shall not act upon a Property of which they are not the owner without the owner's express permission, except when necessary to remedy a situation in which that owner has infringed Property rights of other people or violated a promise binding in Property. A Person in breach of this Non-Aggression Principle shall bear the risks and consequences of their actions.

### Art. 7
### Right to Defend Property

Everyone shall allow Persons to protect their Property and, with the owner's agreement, also the Property of others from infringement which constitute a breach of the Non-Aggression Principle.

### Art. 8
### The Public Defender of Property

§ 1  

To resolve situations where the Non-Aggression Principle is not observed, or where there is a real risk of property damage or destruction, the people appoint a public protector of Property rights. The sole public protector of Property rights in the land shall be the State of Liberland, henceforth, "Liberland".   

§ 2

Liberland shall be able, where necessity requires this and only to the extent as required by circumstance, to infringe on the property rights of others by limiting them in the minimal fashion necessary to resolve the given situation.
