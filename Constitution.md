Constitution of Liberland
========

Preamble
========

We, the free people of this world, in order to protect our right to Life, to our Property, and to secure liberty for ourselves and for future generations, do establish this Constitution of the Republic of Liberland.

Book 1
======

Basic Principles
================

### Art. 1

### Right to Property in One's Being and Right to Life

1) A human being has the sole, undivided, and absolute ownership of their Person; their body, their mind, and their actions; for the duration of their life.

2) This right to ownership, or Property, in one's own being is self-evident and is the basis of all liberty. This right shall be respected by all Persons and protected against all who would infringe upon it.

### Art. 2

### Freedom to Act

A human being owns the Property in their own human actions, and they are free to act or refrain from acting as they see fit as long as their actions concern their own Property and do not interfere with the Property of others.

### Art. 3

### Right to Property in Objects

1) A Person who acts and mixes their labour with something in the world, be it a thing, an animal, or any other controllable natural phenomenon, henceforth: "Object", which is as of yet unowned by another Person, shall be acknowledged as the owner of the Object and the Object becomes their Property.

2) A Person shall in no way be limited in the free use of their Property, and they may alter or sell the Object of it or destroy or dispose of the Object as they see fit.

### Art. 4

### Right to Transfer Property

§ 1

1) A Person shall not be limited without their consent in their freedom to transfer the ownership of the Object of their Property, in whole or in part, for the good of a different Person.

2) That other Person shall, should they accept the transfer, thus become the new owner of that Property according to the extent to which the previous owner transferred the Property, or a part thereof, to them.

§ 2

1) A Person may likewise relinquish an owned Object or its part, and the relinquished Property shall then become liable to be claimed for ownership by another Person.

2) In case such actions lead to the ownership of two Persons in different Properties to one Object, those Persons become co-owners of that object, each holding a distinct Property in it. More than one Person may likewise agree to share ownership in one Property to the same Object.

### Art. 5

### Non-Perishable Nature of Property

A Person shall be acknowledged as the owner of their Property for as long as they see fit, and the rights of the owner towards the object of their Property shall not diminish nor disappear with the passage of time alone.

### Art. 6

### Non-aggression Principle

No Person shall act upon a Property of which they are not the owner without the express permission of the owner of that Property. In order to be valid, such permission must be given based upon a clear appreciation and understanding of the facts, implications, and consequences of the action, henceforth, "Informed Consent".

### Art. 7

### Right to Defend Property

1) A Person shall have the inherent right to protect their Property, including their Person, as well as the Object of that Property, from infringement.

2) A Person shall likewise have the right to protect the Property of others, including their Persons, as long as it is with their agreement and Informed Consent as to the nature of that protection.

3) The right of Persons to establish bodies based on voluntary cooperation that further coordinate human action and choose their coordinators and representatives from amongst their membership shall be respected.

### Art. 8

### The Public Defender of Property

1) Where the Non-Aggression Principle is not observed, by some actor or by all, in full or in part, or where Informed Consent cannot be obtained in a situation of necessity and property can be damaged or destroyed, an intervention needs to happen, accompanied by a possible derogation from these rights or the limiting of their enjoyment. This is to prevent situations where might would make right and to prevent unnecessary damage. The sole subject empowered to intervene in this way shall be the State of Liberland, henceforth, "Liberland". 

2) Liberland shall be the public defender of the Non-Aggression Principle and the Property rights of all the people, especially those who want to have their Property protected, but are incapable to defend it themselves.

3) Liberland shall act where it is apparent that the owner is unable to effectively protect their property or where specifically called to action by the owner or by concerned third parties. Liberland shall be able, where necessity requires this and only to the extent as required by circumstance, to infringe on the property rights of others by limiting them in the minimal fashion necessary to resolve the given situation. .

### Art. 9

### Equality of All

Liberland shall in equal measure defend all property, treating all persons as equals. Liberland shall therefore not act in an arbitrary manner; rather, an orderly system shall be put in place governing all its actions and its structure.

b) Verdicts which represent the decision in a particular case and, where they gain legal force, shall be binding in perpetuity.
