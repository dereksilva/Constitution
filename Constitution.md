# The Constitution of the Republic of Liberland

## Preamble

We, the People of the Free World, in order to protect our right to life, to our Property and to secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, do establish this Constitution of the Free Republic of Liberland.

## Book 1

## Basic Principles

##

### **Art. 1**

### **Right to Property in one&#39;s being, or right to life**

#### § 1

1) A human being has the sole, undivided and absolute ownership of their Person; their body, their mind and their actions; for the duration of their natural life.

2) This right to ownership, or Property, in one&#39;s own being, is recognized as self-evident and is the basis of all liberty. It shall be respected by all Persons and protected against all who would infringe upon it.

##

### **Art. 2**

### **Freedom to act**

#### § 2

A human being owns the Property on their own human actions, and they are free to act or refrain from action as they see fit as long as their actions concern their own Property and do not interfere with the Property of others.

##

### **Art. 3**

### **Right to Property in objects**

#### § 3

A Person who acts and mixes their labour with a thing, an animal, or any other controllable natural phenomenon, henceforth: &quot;Object&quot;, which is as of yet unowned by another Person, shall be acknowledged as the owner of the Object and the Object becomes their Property.

##

#### § 4

A Person shall in no way be limited in their free disposal of their Property, and they may change the Object of it or destroy the Object as they see fit.

##

#### § 5

1) A Person shall in no way be limited in their freedom to transfer their ownership of the Object of their Property, in whole or in part, for the good of a different Person.

2) That other Person shall thus become the new owner of that Property according to the extent to which the previous owner transferred the Property, or a part thereof, to them.

##

#### § 6

1) A Person may likewise relinquish an owned Object or its part, and the relinquished Property shall then become liable to be claimed for ownership by another Person.

2) In case the actions described under 1) and 2) lead to the ownership of two Persons in different Properties of one Object, those Persons become co-owners of that object, each holding a distinct Property in it.

##

#### § 7

A Person shall be acknowledged as the owner of their Property for as long as they see it fit, and Property shall not diminish nor disappear with time.

##

#### § 8

At any given time, a specific Property to one distinct Object shall only be owned by one Person. No Person shall assume the ownership of a Property already owned by another.

##

### **Art. 4**

### **Non-aggression principle**

#### § 9

No Person shall act upon a Property of which they are not the owner without the express permission of the owner of that Property.

##

#### § 10

1) A Person shall have an inherent right to protect their Property, including their Person, as well as the Object of that Property, from infringement.

2) A Person shall likewise have the right to protect the Property of others, including their Persons, as long as it is with their agreement and informed consent also as to the nature of that protection.

##

#### § 11

1) It is common among the People of the Free World to establish bodies based on voluntary cooperation that further coordinate human action.

2) The right of Persons to establish such bodies and choose from amongst their membership their coordinators and representatives shall be respected.

##


## Book 2

## The Public Administration

###

### **Art. 1**

### **Stated purpose**

#### § 12

To ensure that the Right to Property shall be respected and efficiently protected under all circumstances, even in situations when it is not in the owner&#39;s powers to provide this protection themselves, the Public Administration of Liberland, henceforth &quot;Public Administration&quot;, shall be established.

#### § 13

The purpose of the Public Administration shall be to act as the public protector of the Right to Life and the Right to Property in Objects and as the public guarantor of the Non-Aggression Principle.

### **Art. 2**

### **Actions of the Public Administration**

#### § 14

The Public Administration shall only perform such actions to which it is empowered, directly or indirectly, by this Constitution. It shall only act inasmuch as is necessary to fulfil its purpose as stated in this Constitution.

#### § 15

The Public Administration shall act using its employees and other people, such as volunteers and contractors. Any Persons acting in this capacity shall be called Agents of the Public Administration, henceforth &#39;Agents&#39;.

### **Art. 3**

### **Regulative power**

#### § 16

1) To ensure that the social situation will be stable and conducive for the Stated Purpose, the Public Administration shall establish rules and guidelines that inform human action and guide the people to act in more predictable ways that are less likely to clash with actions of other people.

2) This shall be accomplished by issuing Regulations within the limits of this Constitution, which shall not deny, but better define and specify the meanings of the Freedom to Act and shall enable a better and a more universal application of the Non-Aggression Principle.

#### § 17

Regulations shall be binding on Persons inasmuch as they conform to this Constitution.

#### § 18

1) The Public Administration and this Constitution shall consider such a human action as shall conform not only to this Constitution but also to all valid regulations of Public Administration to be a &#39;Lawful action&#39;.

2) Lawful action shall profit from special rights and freedoms according to this Constitution as it represents less of a risk to the peace and stability of the community than other action.

3) Lawful action shall not be liable for punishment by Public Administration and shall in no wise be called nor considered a delict.

####

#### § 19

The Public Administration shall only use its regulatory power when given the power to it by this Constitution. All regulations shall be made in all ways conform with a strict interpretation of this Constitution.

##

#### § 20

The Public Administration shall obey its own regulations.

##

### **Art. 4**

### **Division of power**

#### § 21

​ In order to safeguard the workings of the Republic of Liberland, henceforth &quot;Liberland&quot;, from tyranny or the takeover of Liberland by special interests through the Public Administration, shall the Public Administration be composed not of one institution nor shall it be based on one nexus of power, but it shall be divided, and that into at least three distinct branches of power: the Judicial Power, the Legislative Power and the Executive Power.

##

#### § 22

Each branch of the Public Administration shall be distinct in its tasks and in its powers, and those tasks and powers shall be described with great precision in this Constitution.

##

##

### **Art. 5**

### **Financing the Public Administration**

#### § 23

1) The Public Administration shall be financed in accordance with the Non-Aggression Principle, based on contractual relationships, such as voluntary, project-based taxation based on consent, gifts and inheritances and other instruments of voluntary commerce.

2) The Public Administration shall also finance itself using, renting, selling and holding its own Property. In this capacity, it shall enjoy the same rights and the same freedom of the Market as any Person would, as long as it acts in ways a private entrepreneur would act, and not from the position of a government body.

#### § 24

In order to allow the regular working of the Public Administration, a Land Fee shall be established. This Land Fee shall likewise function in a contractual manner.

##

#### § 25

1) In order to institute the Land Fee on a property, the Public Administration shall, upon

a) the incorporation of any real estate Property unto the jurisdiction of Liberland; or

b) the purchase or development of any real estate in its jurisdiction from the State

establish a permanent co-proprietorship of the Public Administration to the given piece of real estate, which shall always be attached to that real estate, and the Public Administration shall not be able to eschew it.

2) This co-proprietorship shall be retained by the Public Administration irrespective of any change of main ownership of the Property for as long as the Property exists.

#### § 26

This co-proprietorship shall be very limited in order not to disturb free commerce in the land. As such, it shall not give Public Administration any rights except

a) to procure payments of a Land Fee set up according to Law and this Constitution, beforehand and in a transparent manner; and

b) to expropriate the real estate should the Land Fee be long overdue for payment and all the other options of obtaining the due payments or all attempts to find the other owners of the Property will have repeatedly failed.

#### § 27

The Public Administration shall draft and regularly maintain a Regulation which shall

a) set up the details regarding the Land Fee, including but not limited to the formula of how it is to be counted and the manner of payment; and

b) the clear rules for the expropriation, including further conditions necessary to fulfil before this expropriation occurs.

##

###

### **Art. 5**

### **Limits of power**

#### § 28

1) Any regulative, especially legislative action of the Public Administration, shall be liable to be tested against this Constitution directly in any legal dispute or arbitration or any other action in law and other situations prescribed by this Constitution.

2) Only such Regulation as is liable to pass a Constitutional test of conformity shall serve as the binding interpretation of this Constitution.

##

#### § 29

1) The Public Administration is mandated to specify further what is lawful in human action, and it hereby sets boundaries on human action. Therefore, it presents the risk that it could abuse the powers entrusted to it and use them against Persons in a manner that does not conform to this Constitution&#39;s basic principles.

2) To mitigate this risk and prevent this abuse of power where possible, the Public Administration shall, in any and all of their actions, in their policymaking and their day-to-day business, respect and protect certain principles and limitations and afford certain rights to all human beings.

3) This Constitution provides the list of these principles, limitations and rights to which the Public Administration shall always adhere and which shall form the cornerstone of their work, henceforth &quot;the Bill of Rights&quot;.

##

####

#### § 30

The Public Administration shall interpret and apply those human rights in ways that are the most conducive to the individual&#39;s freedom and the principles it exists to safeguard.

#### § 31

1) The list enshrined in the Bill of Rights shall in no wise be exhaustive, and later Regulations can expand it.

2) No rights shall be added that would not be compatible with this Constitution and its basic principles.

##

#### § 71

Interest in borrowed assets represents the value of time preference on the market and is an important indicator for all market actors.

##

####

Should Public Administration become in its capacity to act as an entrepreneur would on the free market the owner of a money system, such as a cryptocurrency blockchain or a mint, it will be free to act as any such an owner and entrepreneur would towards the supply and the issuance of that money or a monetary system or any other similar instruments.

#### § 76

1) Public Administration shall force no Person to register and/or share information about themselves, their religion, medical conditions, fingerprints, DNA, political affiliation and the like.
